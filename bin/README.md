# MP3

A repository for my third mini-project for CSC-207.
@Author: John Miller
This is the readme file for assignment MP3: Text Layout.
This is written by John Miller and based off of the lab on
text layout. Finally, this is meant to be compiled and run
from the TextBlockTests java file for testing.
